<h1 id="A1">What is Statistics?</h1>
<p>Statistics is the science concerned with developing and 
studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting data.</p>

<br>

<p>At the end of this course you should...</p>

<ul>
<li>Understand and appreciate how statistics 
affects your daily life and the fundamental role of statistics in all disciplines;</li>
<li>Evaluate statistics and statistical studies you encounter in your other courses;</li>
<li>Critically read news stories based on statistical studies as 
an informed consumer of data;</li>
<li>Assess the role of randomness and variability in different contexts;</li>
<li>Use basic methods to conduct and analyze statistical studies; </li>
<li>Evaluate and communicate answers to the four pillars of statistical inference:

<ul>
<li>How strong is the evidence of an effect?</li>
<li>What is the size of the effect?</li>
<li>How broadly do the conclusions apply?</li>
<li>Can we say what caused the observed difference?</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>Throughout the course we will use the six steps of statistical 
investigation to explore and analyze different types of data.</p>

<img>

<h3>What is data?</h3>

<br>

<p>Before we begin to analyze data, we must first explore the data.
 Data is information collected on people, places, animals, and many other things.  
In this course we will refer to these as the observational units.   
The data will tell a story about the observational units we collected information on.  
We will create numerical and visual summaries to explore what the data tell us 
about these observational units.</p>

<br>
<img>

<p>When identifying the observational units, look for the sample size – 
the observational unit will follow the sample size
<ul>
<li>i.e.   a random sample of 100 MSU students</li>
<ul>
<li>the sample size is 100</li>
<li>the observational units are MSU students</li>
</ui>
</ul>
</ul>
</p>

<br>

<p>Data is collected as variables.  
There are two types of variables; Qualitative or Categorical 
and Quantitative or Numerical.  
When identifying the variable think about what is being measured 
and what the possible outcomes could be.</p>

<br>

<h3 id="A2">Categorical Data</h3>

<br>

<p>Categorical data is descriptive information like the color of a person’s eyes,
 whether or not someone has a student loan, and whether or not a student lives on campus.
  Some variables will only have two possible outcomes.  
For example, the possible outcomes for whether or not you live on campus is yes or no.  
For the variable color of eyes there are many possible outcomes: 
brown, blue, green, hazel, etc.  
To summarize categorical data we will look at number of times (count or frequency) 
that an outcome occurs or the proportion of times (relative frequency) 
an outcome occurs out of the total number of observational units (sample size).</p>

<br>

<h3>Quantitative Data</h3>

<br>

<p>Quantitative data is numerical information like height, GPA, or fastest speed driven.  
With quantitative data a number will be given as the possible outcome.  
To summarize quantitative data we will find a measure of center and a measure of spread.  
One measure of center is the mean or average.  
To find the mean we add up all the data values in the dataset 
and divide by the sample size.  
When we use the mean as the measure of center 
we will calculate the standard deviation as the measure of spread.  
The standard deviations is the variability around the mean that measures how far, 
on average, each value is from the mean.  
The median is the 50th percentile or the center data point.  
Fifty percent of values in the dataset fall below the median and 50% above.  
The measure of spread that we use with the median is the Interquartile range or the IQR.  
To find the IQR we take the value for the upper quartile (Q3) 
minus the value for the lower quartile (Q1).  
These quartiles represent the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile, respectively.</p>

<br>

<h3 id="A3">Examples</h3>

<p>In this visualization taken from the Pew Research Center, we see 
	that US adults have more confidence in medical scientists 
	since the COVID-19 outbreak than in the previous years. </p>

<img src="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/wp-content/
	uploads/sites/16/2020/06/PS_2020.06.03_Sci-Am-trust_00-1.png">

<p>In this study, the observational units are US adults as that is the 
	group that PEW Research surveyed.  
	here are several different variables depicted here:</p>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Variable</th>
    <th>Possible Outcomes</th>
    <th>Type of Variable</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Year</td>
    <td>2016, 2019, 2020</td>
    <td>Categorical</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Political Party</td>
    <td>Republican (or leaning rep),
	Democrat (or leaning dem)</td>
    <td>Categorical</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Whether they have confidence in medical scientists</td>
    <td>Yes or No</td>
    <td>Categorical</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Notice that the last variable is written as 
“whether they have confidence in medical scientists.” 
The variable represents what is measured on each observational unit, 
in this case whether they have confidence in medical scientists.  
We are not measuring the percentage or proportion that have confidence, 
this is the statistic not the variable and cannot be measured on a 
single observational unit.  The variable is also not “confidence in medical scientists” 
as this would only represent one possible outcome.  
We could also write the variable “political party” as 
“whether or not they are a democrat.”</p>

for a total possible score of 400 to 1600.</p>

<br>

<p>The observational units are High School 
Seniors who took the SAT in 2018.  
We have to be specific about the observational units.  
We cannot just say High School students as there are no variables collected on 
Freshman or Sophomores. The variables collected on these students:</p>
